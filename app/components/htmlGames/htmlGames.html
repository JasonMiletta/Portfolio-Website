            Here's some HTML 5 games I created with javascript using the 
            <a href="http://phaser.io/">Phaser</a>
            framework. These were the result of a challenge I made
            for myself to last a month finishing one game a week 
            in my free time. The art assets were created myself using
            <a href="http://www.getpaint.net/index.html">paint.net</a>
            to quickly mock up sprites and backgrounds.
